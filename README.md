# Diabetes Risk - A Multilevel Analysis of Health, Lifestyle, Demographics, and Socioeconomic Factors

This research uses information from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sys- tem (BRFSS) to examine the risk variables linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study finds significant predictors of T2DM, including demographic, lifestyle, clinical, and so- cioeconomic characteristics, through exploratory data analysis, logistic regression, and probit modeling. 
The results emphasize how important it is for diabetes risk to be influenced by variables like obesity, high cholesterol, age, gender, food, physical activity, mental health, and socioeconomic position. The necessity of focused public health initiatives to support healthy lifestyles, enhance healthcare service accessibility, tackle socioeconomic inequalities, and cus- tomize preventative measures based on demographic traits are among the policy implications. These results advance our knowledge of the risk factors for type 2 diabetes and help guide the creation of successful care and prevention plans.
